A Shared Exploration borrows traits from traditional shared tasks with the distinction in the primary aim of the shared exploration. In contrast to shared tasks, the focus of a Shared Exploration is the analysis of datasets, rather than competitive modeling performance. We will review performance on the datasets in accordance with three criteria detailed below rather than just one evaluation metric. This means that we can adopt a more holistic approach and reward innovative and rigorous analyses, rather than sophisticated engineering.

CRITERIA : 

> Advancement: Generation of new academic knowledge which addresses existing problems in the field, or identifies new problems. You should clearly outline the problem you are addressing and how your analyses respond to it.

> Innovation: Application of new methods, techniques and approaches. This could include combining social scientific methods and theories with advanced engineering solutions.

> Rigour: Specification of a clear research question and a well-executed, well-explained and fully considered research design. This could include integrating the Wikipedia Detox dataset with other sources of data and/or other training datasets.
